# Secure Software Best Practices - CS 305 Software Security ðŸ”’
Artemis Financial is an internationally renowned financial planning firm with a broad clientele. Their fundamental area of expertise is developing customised financial plans that cover things like retirement, insurance, investments, and savings. The company requested a thorough assessment of their software security in light of the firm's global operations and the sensitivity of financial data. Particular emphasis was placed on secure communications and data encryption.

## Increasing layers of security
I carefully examined Artemis Financial's current system and identified specific flaws, especially in the codebase. For instance, I discovered and fixed sensitive data access at the package level by advising encapsulation techniques. I also argued against hardcoding credentials and emphasised the value of using environment variables in order to improve database security.

## Making sure of functional and secure code
I thoroughly tested the code after making the required modifications to ensure that it was functional. I used integration tests to verify how the software worked. More importantly, I performed security scans once more after the refactoring to make sure that no new vulnerabilities were added as a result of the changes.


## What Went Well
During my evaluation of Artemis Financial's software, I successfully located a number of security flaws. Tools and manual inspection were used to accomplish this. Because vulnerabilities can result in significant financial and data losses, it is imperative to code securely. Secure coding also ensures customer trust and upholds a company's reputation. In the long run, strong software security directly affects a company's stability and expansion.

## Challenges I faced
Due to Artemis Financial's global operations, the most challenging aspect of the vulnerability assessment was navigating the complexities of international encryption standards. This challenge, though, turned out to be very helpful. It improved my knowledge of international security standards and sharpened my abilities to guarantee that software complies with multiple legal requirements. By confronting this complexity head-on, I have hopefully honedÂ my ability to potentiallyÂ manage international projects in the future. This experience confirmed the value of adaptability and ongoing learning in cybersecurity.

## Future Plans
I relied heavily on well-established secure coding best practises to uphold the confidentiality and integrity of user data throughout the assessment. I used vulnerability scanners, which were helpful in identifying system vulnerabilities. It has been crucial to embrace coding guidelines that prioritise security, such as the least privilege principle and avoiding hardcoded credentials. I want to combine manual code inspections with sophisticated automated tools in future evaluations. This comprehensive approach will make it easier to identify vulnerabilities quickly, allowing me to fully understand the security landscape of the system and choose the most effective mitigation strategies.
